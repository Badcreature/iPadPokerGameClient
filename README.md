iPad Poker Game Client
====

This is an iPad application designed to work with the Poker Server: https://github.com/jacobhyphenated/PokerServer

This is a basic iPad app that can serve as the game controller for a texas holdem poker game.  The game controller displays the community cards, decides when to deal the cards, and decides when to end the hand.  Player clients are used to represent the players in the game; these are a separate project.

Version
----
This project will work with iOS 6.0+

This application is designed to work with Poker Server API Version 0.1. This is subject to change.

Development
----
The basic functionality for this project is complete.  However, much more needs to be done.

Obviously there is not much design work, and a lot of the UX is in desperate need of improvement.  I will be working on this intermittently, but pull requests are welcome :)
